## DESCRIPTION
Slots could be consider as a missing part of React. It's like Flux, but better.

## TODO
* add transaction context. Add rollbacks and state history navigation
* add performance tests
* add Promise interface support (e.g. Slots.then ect)
* errors handling
* async tests. More tests for Promises
* rules which are dependent on state conditions (eg Flux waitFor)
* add support for groups of (sub)rules. Could be useful for sharing common rules
* monitoring capabilities (for progress bars, for example) and better debugging
* pure immutable version w/o conversion fromJS and .toJS
* more examples
